# Claude Code (Unofficial Source Extraction)

> **This is NOT an official Anthropic repository.**

This repository contains the extracted TypeScript source code of [Anthropic's Claude Code](https://www.anthropic.com/) CLI tool — Anthropic's official CLI that lets you interact with Claude directly from the terminal to perform software engineering tasks like editing files, running commands, searching codebases, managing git workflows, and more.

The source was obtained by unpacking the source map (`cli.js.map`) bundled with the officially published npm package.

- **npm package:** [@anthropic-ai/claude-code v2.1.88](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@anthropic-ai/claude-code/v/2.1.88)
- **Official homepage:** [github.com/anthropics/claude-code](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code)

## How It Leaked

The source code leak was discovered by [Chaofan Shou (@Fried_rice)](https://x.com/Fried_rice) and posted publicly on March 31, 2026:

> *"Claude code source code has been leaked via a map file in their npm registry!"*

> — [@Fried_rice](https://x.com/Fried_rice), March 31, 2026

The published npm package (`@anthropic-ai/claude-code`) included a source map file (`cli.js.map`) containing the full, unobfuscated TypeScript source code. The `sourcesContent` field of the source map held every original `.ts`/`.tsx` file that was bundled into `cli.js`, making the entire codebase trivially extractable.

## Why does this exist?

Anthropic publishes Claude Code as a bundled JavaScript CLI on npm. The published package includes a source map file (`cli.js.map`) that contains the original TypeScript source. This repository simply extracts and preserves that source for easier reading and reference.

## How to get it yourself

### Clone this repository

**Using HTTPS** (recommended — no SSH key required):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yujingcheong/claude-code.git
cd claude-code
```

**Using SSH** (requires an SSH key configured with GitHub):

```bash
git clone git@github.com:yujingcheong/claude-code.git
cd claude-code
```

> If you get `Permission denied (publickey)` when using SSH, use the HTTPS URL above instead, or [add your SSH key to GitHub](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account).

### Or extract it yourself from npm

1. **Install the package:**

```bash
mkdir claude-code-extract && cd claude-code-extract
npm pack @anthropic-ai/claude-code@2.1.88
tar -xzf anthropic-ai-claude-code-2.1.88.tgz
cd package
```

2. **Run the unpack script:**

Create a file called `unpack.mjs`:

```js
import { readFileSync, writeFileSync, mkdirSync } from "fs";
import { dirname, join } from "path";

const mapFile = join(import.meta.dirname, "cli.js.map");
const outDir = join(import.meta.dirname, "unpacked");

console.log("Reading source map...");
const map = JSON.parse(readFileSync(mapFile, "utf-8"));

const sources = map.sources || [];
const contents = map.sourcesContent || [];

console.log(`Found ${sources.length} source files.`);

let written = 0;
let skipped = 0;

for (let i = 0; i < sources.length; i++) {
  const src = sources[i];
  const content = contents[i];

  if (content == null) {
    skipped++;
    continue;
  }

  const outPath = join(outDir, src.replace(/^\.\.\//g, ""));
  mkdirSync(dirname(outPath), { recursive: true });
  writeFileSync(outPath, content);
  written++;
}

console.log(`Done! Wrote ${written} files to ${outDir}`);
if (skipped > 0) console.log(`Skipped ${skipped} files with no content.`);
```

3. **Run it:**

```bash
node unpack.mjs
```

The extracted source will be in the `unpacked/` directory.
